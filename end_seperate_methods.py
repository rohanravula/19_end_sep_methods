"Cancadarion" #to get space or multiple spaces between the string then this method is used. to join the mutiple string also the cancadation method is used.
# print("pyt"+"hon") #python. joining the two strings is called cancadation.
# print("super"+"5") #super5. if their is a int or float number convert into that into str and cancadate the both strings. this is method 1.
# print("sper"+str(5)) #super5. Method 2. this all the without space one.
"tow get single space or multiple spaces in cancadation"
# print("roh","an") #roh an. by keeping (,) comma we can get the single space.
# print("roh " "an") #roh an.  in this way also we can get the single space beteween the strings.
# print("roh" " an") #roh an. this is also one method to get the single space between the strings.

# print("rohan"+'  '+"kumar"+'  '+"ravula") #rohan  kumar  ravula. (Two spaces).  by adding the (+) or an empty sting in between the strings we can get the multinple spaces.

"seperate"
# print(1,2,3,4,5,sep=("  ")) #1  2  3  4  5. (two spaces by using seperate it is easy to give multiple spaces.) This sepertate method workds when their is a comma(,) between the strings.
# print(1,2,3,4,5,sep=("@")) #1@2@3@4@5.

"End" # this end is having with the only 2nd print statement only .
# print("python",end=(""))
# print("programming") #pythonprogramming. the end statement is interlinked with only with 2nd line only.

# print("python",end=("@"))
# print("programming") #python@programming.

# print("python",end=("   "))
# print("programming") #python   programming. this end statemet is only interlinked with only with the secon print statement only. it has no connection with the 3rd print statement.
# print("version") #version

# print("python",end=("  "))
# print("programming",end=("  "))
# print("version") #python  programming  version. when we keep end statement in second line also then it works with thrid line too vis versa.

# print("python",end=(""))
# print("code",end=(""))
# print("Version") #pythoncodeVersion

# "combination of end & seperate"
# print(1,2,3,4,end=" ",sep="-")
# print(5,6,7,8,sep=" ",end=".")
# print(9,10) #1-2-3-4 5 6 7 8.9 10

"\n"
# print("python\n" "programming") #python next line programming
# print("python" "\nprogramming")  #python next line programming
# print("python\n" "\nprogramming")  #python next line empty  then programming

# print("hello"*3) #hellohellohello
# print("hello "*3) #hello hello hello
# print("hello\n"*3) #by using this method we will get the answer in vrtically. but after printing 3 times hello in vertically at last also we will get the one empty line also.

print("hello\n"*3,end="") #we will get no space at the end
